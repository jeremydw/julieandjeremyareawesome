    <h2>How we met</h2>
    <p>Julie and Jeremy met in 2009 while working on the same project at Google. At the time, Julie was working on an April Fools' joke for Google Maps. Our paths crossed when Jeremy was debugging a technical problem with one of the web pages and after everything was resolved, Julie proudly announced that – for the April Fools' joke – the yellow Street View figure was replaced by a panda that you could pick up by the "scruff of its neck". Jeremy thought this was both extremely odd and oddly cute.
    <p>Later on, Julie needed a website for her new project. She wanted Jeremy to build it for her, but he was too busy. When Jeremy said no, they went to his manager. When he said no, they went to <i>his</i> manager and finally Jeremy agreed. From there, once they began working together, it was <b><em>love at first site</em></b>.

    <h2>Three years later</h2>
    <p>Jeremy proposed to Julie exactly on their three year anniversary in front of the Golden Gate Bridge (this is where they first asked each other out!). Julie sleeps in on weekends, so Jeremy woke up early and frantically checked the weather all morning on public webcams to make sure it wasn't too foggy. In order to buy some time until the fog cleared up, Jeremy took Julie to exercise at a gym nearby.

    <p>On the way to lunch after the gym, Jeremy announced that they would be stopping at the Golden Gate Bridge to take some action shots with his rented GoPro camera (which he had been talking about for the past month). He parked the car near the pier at <a href="http://goo.gl/vw5vOL">Moore Rd</a> with a perfect view of the Bridge, balanced the GoPro camera on the hood of the car and told Julie to stand near the water. Julie didn't suspect a thing until Jeremy got very nervous when a car of tourists appeared nearby. After waiting impatiently until the blissfully-unaware group of tourists finally left, Jeremy got down on one knee and asked Julie a very important question.
