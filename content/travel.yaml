    <h2>Wedding venue</h2>
    <p>Our wedding will take place at <b>Paradise Ridge Winery</b> in Santa Rosa, California! Santa Rosa is about a one hour drive north of San Francisco. It is located in California's wine country.

    <h2>Airports</h2>
    <p>There are a few airports that you can use. The most common option is likely the San Francisco Airport (SFO), but you may also choose to fly to Oakland or Sacramento.
    <p>If you are flying from California (or nearby), you may choose to fly to Sonoma Airport directly (which is very close to Santa Rosa).
    <p>If you fly in Saturday morning, there will be enough time for you to rent a car and travel to Santa Rosa by the greeting time (5pm).
